When I switched to MacOS it really was something different. Coming from Windows I didn't feel at home but I was open to adjust my workflow to fit MacOS best.

First thing my colleagues showed me was Spotlight. This is basically an app launcher and search tool on your OS. But it also has some neat little features like calculating in the search bar or searching the web. This is kind of nice but a huge difference to the search on windows.

Then I discovered Raycast and was immediately hooked on it. This has more built in tools and actual integrations with other apps. Jira is a good example for this. You can look at your assigned tickets, create tickets, change the status of tickets and a lot more. And that right at your fingertips. 

But that is not all the biggest strength of Raycast is the extension system and with that the community. There are so many extensions for every application or task I wanna do. And if there isn't one I can easily write my own commands or a whole extension.

So let's get into how I use Raycast to improve my "[[tags/productivity]]".

# General

## Calendar Events

 Raycast basically reads your calendar and parses the events for meeting links. If it finds one you can directly join this from within of Raycast. 
 
 This is definitely one of my most used features and of the features that saves me the most amount of clicking.

They even have a camera preview now before you join the meeting which is kind of nice.

## App switching

This is pretty obvious, but this has a few things about it which makes the app switching especially good and fast. The way MacOS app switching works is that if you have the application not open yet it will open the app, but if there is an instance of that app open it switches the focus to that app. I really like this behaviour

You can of course type in the app you wanna use and Raycast will find it. But you can also assign aliases to apps. For example Firefox could just be `ff`. Then you only type in that and press space and you opened that app. You could also assign a keybind to the app and that completely changed my workflow. Because of the way mac handles app launch/switch this just enables you to navigate to the open app regardless on which space its located.
