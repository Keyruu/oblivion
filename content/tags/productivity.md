description: What I consider to be productivity.
---
I don't really like the term productivity. In the end I probably spend more time working on my "productivity" than actually saving time with it. 

What I consider to be productivity for me is how convenient something for me to do is. If I can achieve something with a keyboard shortcut rather than navigating to a menu in an app than that is something I would consider making more productive or rather happier with my workflow.

It's just a lot of fun tweaking things to be as "productive" as one can be. So please take this term with a grain of salt.
