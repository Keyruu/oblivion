This isn't really a [[tags/blog|blog]] and I'm not really a blogger. I hate writing, and I'm not very good at it.
I'm just using this as a place to put my thoughts and ideas.

This is a place for my fragmented memories to be stored.

As Sora forgets his memories in Castle Oblivion, this should be a place for me to remember mine.
